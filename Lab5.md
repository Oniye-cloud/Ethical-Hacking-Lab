| **Tool Examples**         | `whois`, `theHarvester`, `Google Dorking`, `Shodan`     | `nmap`, `ping`, `netdiscover`, `traceroute` |
| **Data Source**           | Publicly available information (no contact with target) | Directly interacts with the target system   |
| **Risk Level**            | Low                                                     | High                                        |
| **Detection Possibility** | Minimal                                                 | High                                        |
| **Speed**                 | Slower, depends on online data                          | Faster, controlled by tester                |
| **Legal Concerns**        | Usually safe if done ethically                          | Requires permission from the target owner   |




Summary

Passive reconnaissance is best used at the beginning of an assessment to quietly gather public information about a target without alerting them.
Active reconnaissance is used after defining scope and getting permission, to scan and test the targetâ€™s live systems for open ports and services. It provides deeper technical details but carries a higher risk of detection.
